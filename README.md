# TW3T Debugger

This is a simple proof of concept TOML Web3 token generator, which is using [tw3t](https://github.com/hamidra/tw3t) to generate and verify toml web3 tokens.  
The usual test signers (Alice, Bob, Dave, ...) are loaded by default and if you have polkadot.js extension installed you can authorize the app to load your signer accounts from your extension.
